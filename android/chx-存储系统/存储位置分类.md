* external storage

Android provides two types of physical storage locations: `internal storage` and `external storage`. 

Removable volumes, such as an SD card, appear in the file system as part of external storage. Android represents these devices using a path, such as `/sdcard`.

Apps themselves are stored within internal storage by default. 

If your APK size is very large, however, you can indicate a preference within your app's manifest file to install your app on external storage instead:

```
<manifest ...
  android:installLocation="preferExternal">
  ...
</manifest>
```
