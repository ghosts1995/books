## 3. `SIP.js Simple` vs `full API`

* I am using Simple and would like to do something that is not supported. Can you add support for it?

> No. Simple is intended to help get someone up and running quickly. If you need to do something more please upgrade to the [full SIP.js API](https://sipjs.com/api/0.15.0/).
