A Loki-based logging stack consists of 3 components:
- promtail is the agent, responsible for gathering logs and sending them to Loki.(promtail是 agent，负责收集日志并将其发送给 Loki。)
- loki is the main server, responsible for storing logs and processing queries.(loki是主服务器，负责存储日志和处理查询。)
- Grafana for querying and displaying the logs.
