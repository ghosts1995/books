```
export default [
  {
    path: '/regulation/index',
    name: 'RegulationIndex',
    redirect: '/regulation/index/TypicalCase',
    // route level code-splitting
    // this generates a separate chunk (regulationIndex.[hash].js) for this route
    // which is lazy-loaded when the route is visited.
    component: () => import(/* webpackChunkName: "RegulationIndex" */ 'page/regulation/RegulationIndex'),
    children: [
      {
        path: '/regulation/index/TypicalCase',
        name: 'TypicalCase',
        component: () => import(/* webpackChunkName: "TypicalCase" */ 'page/regulation/case/TypicalCase')
      },
      {
        path: '/regulation/index/LawsAndRegulations',
        name: 'LawsAndRegulations',
        component: () => import(/* webpackChunkName: "LawsAndRegulations" */ 'page/regulation/laws/LawsAndRegulations')
      }
    ]
  },
]
```

核心是在父路由 redirect 到子路由：`redirect: '/regulation/index/TypicalCase',`
