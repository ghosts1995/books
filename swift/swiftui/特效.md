extension View {

    /// Sets a clipping shape for this view.
    ///
    /// By applying a clipping shape to a view, you preserve the parts of the
    /// view covered by the shape, while eliminating other parts of the view.
    /// The clipping shape itself isn't visible.
    ///
    /// For example, this code applies clipping shape to a square image:
    ///
    ///     Image(name: "artichokes")
    ///         .clipShape(Circle())
    ///
    /// The resulting view shows only the portion of the image that lies within
    /// the bounds of the circle.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - shape: The clipping shape to use for this view. The `shape` fills
    ///     the view's frame, while maintaining its aspect ratio.
    ///   - style: The fill style to use when rasterizing `shape`.
    /// - Returns: A view that clips this view to `shape`, using `style` to
    ///   define the shape's rasterization.
    @inlinable public func clipShape<S>(_ shape: S, style: FillStyle = FillStyle()) -> some View where S : Shape


    /// Clips this view to its bounding rectangular frame.
    ///
    /// By default, a view's bounding frame is used only for layout, so any
    /// content that extends beyond the edges of the frame is still visible.
    /// Use the `clipped()` modifier to hide any content that extends beyond
    /// these edges.
    ///
    /// - Parameter antialiased: A Boolean value that indicates whether
    ///   smoothing is applied to the edges of the clipping rectangle.
    /// - Returns: A view that clips this view to its bounding frame.
    @inlinable public func clipped(antialiased: Bool = false) -> some View


    /// Clips this view to its bounding frame, with the specified corner radius.
    ///
    /// By default, a view's bounding frame only affects its layout, so any
    /// content that extends beyond the edges of the frame remains visible.
    /// Use the `cornerRadius()` modifier to hide any content that extends
    /// beyond these edges while applying a corner radius.
    ///
    /// The following code applies a corner radius of 20 to a square image:
    ///
    ///     Image(name: "walnuts")
    ///         .cornerRadius(20)
    ///
    /// - Parameter antialiased: A Boolean value that indicates whether
    ///   smoothing is applied to the edges of the clipping rectangle.
    /// - Returns: A view that clips this view to its bounding frame.
    @inlinable public func cornerRadius(_ radius: CGFloat, antialiased: Bool = true) -> some View

    /// Adds a shadow to this view.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - color: The shadow's color.
    ///   - radius: The shadow's size.
    ///   - x: A horizontal offset you use to position the shadow relative to
    ///     this view.
    ///   - y: A vertical offset you use to position the shadow relative to
    ///     this view.
    /// - Returns: A view that adds a shadow to this view.
    @inlinable public func shadow(color: Color = Color(.sRGBLinear, white: 0, opacity: 0.33), radius: CGFloat, x: CGFloat = 0, y: CGFloat = 0) -> some View
